         <h2> QUANTUM MECHANICS</h2>
         Quantum mechanics is really the a very beautiful field of physics which deals with motion
         of particles. It tells how a particle actually moves.
         Lets look at some of the principles of quantum mechanics
         <li><b>1.SUPERPOSITON: It somehow tells that when two waves strikes they meet to form some new wave which is like
         a resultant of the motion of the two waves. In quantum mechanics everything is just a SUPERPOSITON of waves.</li>
         <li><b>2.HEISENBERG: It states that no one can really measure the position and the momentum of a particle accurately.
         Its not because of lack of technology .. but it is the truth of the nature.</li>
        <li><b>3.ENTANGLEMENT: This says that if two particles are somehow entagled or connected to each other in some way .. when you 
         findone particles ... say spinning anticlockwise.. then from that info you can tell how other particle is behaving </li>

            <h2> SUPERCONDUCTORS</h2>
            Superconductors are those devices in which in which the resistance become 0 at a
            particular temperature. Just imagine if  the resistance become 0 then we would be havinginfinite current 
            to use. This would be so great!
            But how they are made.There are some conductors in which the resistance become 0 at a veryy low temperature while there 
             are some in which resistance become 0 at a very high temperature.
             We just need to find those, or we can even create ... but some researches are still going on to use it properly.

            <h2> COSMOLOGY</h2>
            COSMOLOGY is a part of physics dealing with the study of space. Now a days the main reasearch id going to find planets 
            which are more familiar to earth. WE are also trying hard to know more about The beginning of universe. Yes big bang a THEORY
            but many peopel contradict to it, also ,it never answer the question how all the matter came into existance.

                   UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS
               </h2>
               Unification of physics is the major question in minds of all the physicists. What do we mean by this?
               look, the problem is actually that <a href = "enstein.html"> general relativity</a> is something which goes against 
               quantum mechanics in some cases. Look we want a theory combining all the forces of nature including gravity, Electromagnic,
               nuclear(weak and strong). Actually these forces were combined into just one force. We want to find some symmetries to really 
               know how unification  takes place.
