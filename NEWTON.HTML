            <h1> MECHANICS </h1>

            Newton actually described to us how things move! Starting from his question on gravity he 
            came across great deal of equations describing a lot of mechanical motions.
            lets come across a some of his works on gravitational force.

            <h2>1.GRAVITY</h2>

            Newton gave us the formula that gravitational fprce betweeen two objects is actually 
            proportional to the masses of both of the obejcts but inversely proportional to the 
            inverse of the square of radius. It can  be quite tedious to understand in tbhis language but 
            let me explain. He simply told that if you have two very massive objects and another set of 
            two low mass objects thenthe gravitational force between the 1st set would be more.
            And the force will decrease as we increase the disctance between them.
             
            <h2> 2.Laws of motion</h2>

        take an example that you have a ball. You kicked it. to kick it you apply a FORCE.
        What is that foc=rce actually equal to. Its just proportional to the accelaration of 
        the object. Its so obvious that if you will kick the object harder you will accelarate it
        much more the force is applied. But.. lets assume for a while that you take a metal ball 
        instead. if you will kick it it will kick you back.
        will the ball move if you wont even kick it. ofcourse not!
        here we have summarised the three laws. Dont ever try too cram them !

        
        <h2>
            3.Optics
        </h2>
        Newton somehow was the starter of optics. His experiment in which he made the ligth pass trhough a prism made a history.
        He was the first one who described motion of light, about the reflection, refraction and so on. Lets discuss a few of them
        <ul>
            <li> reflection is the process in which light bounce back when it strikes any opaque obhject</li>
            <li> refraction is the process in which the ligth bends when it passes theough some other medium. 
                The reason of this refraction is the difference in the velocity of light in two mediums.
            </li>
        </ul>
